# Webdevelopment project

## URL 
www.br√∏nstad.com

## Motivation
I started building a website as a part of some web development lessons in Udacitys nanodegree for data scientist program.
I decided to deploy some of the projects that I submitted during the program and as a platform to experiment with web-design/ back-end programming / deploying ML models etc.

## Installations on the web server
- Flask
- Plotly 
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Gunicorn
